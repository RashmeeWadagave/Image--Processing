# Image--Processing

This project recognizes the images using AWS Rekognition feature.

Amazon Rekognition is a machine learning product by AWS that helps in adding image and video analysis to applications. It uses deep learning to analyze images and videos.

Amazon Rekognition uses deep learning models to perform face detection and to search for faces in collections. It continues to improve the accuracy of its models based on customer feedback and advances in deep learning research.
Face detection algorithms typically start by searching for human eyes one of the easiest features to detect. The algorithm might then attempt to detect eyebrows, the mouth, nose, nostrils and the iris. The methods used in face detection can be knowledge-based, feature-based, template matching or appearance-based.

Tech Used: Python, HTML, CSS, Django, DB Browser(SQLlite).
